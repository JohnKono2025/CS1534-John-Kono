I have developed a website that consists of three pages: index.html, history.html, and visit.html. These pages are built with HTML and CSS. I have used the Bootstrap framework for my web design project. I have also created a responsive website that seamlessly adapts to various screen resolutions, including smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers. Also, my project contained Bootstrap components such as the navigation bar, footer, buttons, and a 7:5 column ratio. 

The layout of my website emphasised simplicity and minimalism with an elegant aspect. The primary goal is to ensure that users can easily access information without feeling overwhelmed while navigating the site.

In my design, I carefully selected four colours to create a balanced aesthetic: black and grey, which symbolise passion, power, and formality; white, which represents simplicity and cleanliness; and blue, conveying seriousness, professionalism, and freedom. This balanced colour scheme has aimed to create a harmonious and unified visual experience for the users.

Reflecting on the challenges I faced during this project, I have encountered difficulties setting up the Bootstrap framework and integrating a static map. I have utilised Leaflet with OpenStreetMap and JavaScript to overcome the mapping issue. Additionally, I have effectively managed the layout design for visit.html by utilising a Bootstrap column ratio of 7:5.
